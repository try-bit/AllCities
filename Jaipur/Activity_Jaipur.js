Protected by huge guard walls, the fairy-tale-like structure is still the home of Jaipur's modern-day royal family, and is more extravagant and enchanting than you might imagine."

        text="At first glance, Jantar Mantar may look to be nothing more than a bunch of larger-than-life abstract sculptures. But this is not an art gallery—it's a special collection of astronomical tools started by Rajput ruler Jai Singh II to measure the heavens nearly 300 years ago.
The observatory's massive sun dial, known as Samrat Yantra, is particularly striking. At 27 meters tall, it casts a huge shadow that accurately measures time down to two seconds

It has all of the distinctive architectural features that appear in postcards of the city, from the salmon-pink, honeycombed facade, built to resemble the crown of Hindu god Krishna, to the geometric accents and rows of tiny windows."

The fort is laid out into four separate sections, each of which has a spectacular garden courtyard outside. While you'd never know it from above, you can actually explore the fort's underground tunnels, some of which have been restored."
