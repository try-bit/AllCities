       Shimla is the capital of the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, in the Himalayan foothills. <br/>Once the summer capital of British India, it remains the terminus of the narrow-gauge Kalka-Shimla Railway, completed in 1903. <br/>It’s also known for the handicraft shops that line The Mall, a pedestrian avenue, as well as the Lakkar Bazaar, a market specializing in wooden toys and crafts.
