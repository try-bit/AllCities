 Kochi (also known as Cochin) is a city in southwest India's coastal Kerala state. <br/> It has been a port since 1341, when a flood carved out its harbor and opened it to Arab, Chinese and European merchants. <br/>Sites reflecting those influences include Fort Kochi, a settlement with tiled colonial bungalows and diverse houses of worship. <br/> Cantilevered Chinese fishing nets, typical of Kochi, have been in use for centuries.
